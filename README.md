DESCRIPTION: FOR TASK 1 OF THIS INTERNSHIP I WAS SUPPOSED TO PREPARE A POWER BI SALES REPORT AND VISUALIZE THE DATA USING POWER BI.  The process began with preparing and refining the dataset through the Power Query Editor, ensuring that the information was accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis. This step involved removing duplicates, handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and shaping the data into a structured format suitable for reporting. By cleaning the dataset first, the foundation was set for reliable insights and meaningful visualizations.
Once the data was prepared, a variety of Power BI visuals were applied to present the sales information in a clear and interactive manner. Each visual was chosen strategically to highlight different aspects of the sales performance and to provide stakeholders with a comprehensive view of the business.
Stacked Column Chart
The stacked column chart was used to display sales contributions across multiple categories within a single time frame. This visualization allowed for easy comparison of sub‑categories, such as product lines or regional sales, within the overall totals. It provided a layered perspective, making it simple to identify which segments contributed most to overall performance.
Clustered Column Chart
The clustered column chart was employed to compare sales values across distinct categories side by side. Unlike the stacked chart, this visual separated each category, enabling straightforward comparisons between products, regions, or time periods. It was particularly useful for identifying trends and variations in performance across different segments.
Donut Chart
The donut chart offered a visually appealing way to represent proportions and percentages. It was used to show the share of sales contributed by different categories, such as product types or customer segments. The circular design made it easy to grasp relative contributions at a glance, highlighting dominant categories and areas requiring attention.
Map Visual
The map visual added a geographic dimension to the report. By plotting sales data across regions, it provided insights into location‑based performance. This visualization helped identify strong and weak markets, enabling decision‑makers to focus on geographic areas with growth potential or declining trends.
Slicer
Slicers were incorporated to enhance interactivity and user control. They allowed viewers to filter data dynamically by selecting specific categories, time periods, or regions. This feature made the report highly flexible, enabling stakeholders to explore the dataset according to their unique requirements and gain customized insights.
Area Chart Visual
The area chart was used to illustrate trends over time, particularly cumulative sales growth or decline. By shading the area under the line, this visual emphasized the magnitude of changes and provided a clear picture of overall performance progression. It was effective in highlighting long‑term trends and seasonal variations.


This is about 500 words, written in a professional and descriptive style. Would you like me to also reframe it in a more academic tone (like for a project submission), or keep it in this business‑report style?
